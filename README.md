This is the website content for [neasair.org](https://neasair.org),
created using the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

To generate the website, install Hugo, change to your local website
directory, then run:

```
hugo
```

The website will then be in the "docs" subdirectory.

For doing development on your local computer, the command to run
instead is:

```
hugo serve --disableFastRender
```

This will start a web server on http://localhost:1313, which you
can open using your web browser (eg Firefox, Chrome, etc).
