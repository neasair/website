*NEASAIR provides Anglophone readers interested in security and international relations in North East Asia with a window into the unique perspectives, insights and foci of Chinese, Japanese and Korean language media and analyses.*

NEASAIR is different. It's primary aim is to give Anglophone readers interested in security and international relations in North East Asia a window into the unique perspectives, insights and foci that can be found in Chinese, Japanese and Korean language media and analyses. It does this by providing translations of texts written in these languages in isolation, as opposed to embedding paraphrased sections of the text / small quotes into an analysis, and then subjecting the contents to additional layers of interpretation. It aims to provide up-to-date materials - to the extent that this is possible for what is, at this stage, a one man operation. However, NEASAIR also provides more dated editorials and analyses which are significant, yet which may have escaped the attention of Anglophone scholars / the media. 

Another way that NEASAIR is different is that it complements the existing plethora of blogs / online magazines on international relations / security in the NEA region. Some blogs offer insights into the views and opinions of media and other sources of one specific nation/language group. NEASAIR has the unique advantage of being able to highlight the different viewpoints of different nations in the region in relation to events which effect their collective and individual interests - or which are the cause/product of conflicts of interests between these nations.  Moving forward, there will be a greater attempt to show, side by side, the different opinions of different players in the region on single issues - in particular disputes between nations, wherein writers on one side may be led to misrepresent the position of the other nation. In this sense, NEASAIR hopes to expose readers to the different arguments presented by each side, and not merely the positions attributed to them by third parties.

## NOTES ON TRANSLATION

NEASAIR's foremost goal is to create a 'window' into the region for a general readership. Thus while there will be a greater attention to detail and nuance in cases of diplomatically sensitive issues/statements, in most circumstances, nuances may be brushed over and details may be omitted when they are deemed to be extraneous, confusing, or if they reduce a text's narrative flow. In certain cases, the texts presented on this site may be more aptly described as paraphrases rather than bona fide translations. 

Hence while readers are free to quote the translation that appear on this site, NEASAIR strongly recommends that all translations are checked by a competent/qualified translator before they are used in academic/media or other official/semi-official reports or articles.

## CONTACTING NEASAIR 

Readers are welcome to contact NEASAIR (see below for contact details). In relation to translations - all constructive criticism that addresses flagrant inaccuracies, or areas where the text is ambiguous or unreadable, will be welcome. However, please keep in mind - this is not a forum on translation studies. At this stage, NEASAIR is committed to mobilising its limited resources to providing a window to the region, not a microscope (please note the aforementioned point about 'paraphrase/translation').
