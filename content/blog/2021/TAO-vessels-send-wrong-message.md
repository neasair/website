Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian responded to an enquiry on March 17 by stating an American 
vessel’s navigation through the Taiwan Strait is sending the wrong message to ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist 
forces, is intentionally interfering in, and worsening the situation in, the region, and is damaging and 
endangering peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We resolutely oppose this. We ask that the 
American side scrupulously abide by the One China principle and the rules set forth in the Three Joint 
Communiqués and handle issues related to Taiwan prudently. The People’s Liberation Army always maintains 
high levels of readiness and will be resolute in defending the nation’s sovereignty and territorial 
integrity.

In the regular press briefing held on that day a reporter had mentioned the USS John Finn destroyer’s 
movements through the Taiwan Straight and asked Zhu what she thought about it. The above is Zhu’s reply.

A journalist mentioned that during the “2+2” foreign affairs/defence leader meeting between the United 
States and Japan, America’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken had stated that if mainland China used 
forceful means to harm Taiwan’s democracy, America will definitely strike back. The journalist asked Zhu 
for her response to this.

Zhu pointed out that our position is very clear - the Taiwan problem is a domestic issue for China and 
that they would not tolerate any outside interference. We encourage the American side to scupulously 
abide by the One China Principle and  the rules set forth in the Three Joint Communiqués and handle 
issues related to Taiwan prudently.
