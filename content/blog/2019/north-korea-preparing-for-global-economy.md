(Anchor) Although North Korea is calling for economic construction through self-rejunivation*, internally, Pyongyang is emphasising the concept of globalisation and is attempting to transition its economy.

Kim Jung-un, chairman of North Korea’s state affairs commission, has personally come out and tried to raise awareness about intellectual property rights. 

Kim Jung-bae reports: 

North Korea’s trademarks are mainly written words and are monotonous.

Recently, the international trademarks that North Korea are applying for are upon the first glance alone different in their appearance.    

This is the application for ‘Virgin Snow’ (Cheotnun) - the symbol of a burgeoning state-run trading company operating under the banner of state preservation [picture shown in article].  

It can be seen that the snow crystal has been simplified and the colour and size of the words in the centre are different.   

Pyongyang Trolley produces buses and other items. Its classy logo, which contains the symbol of a Chollima (a mythical winged horse), holds its own against those of prominent global car makers. 

In the Kim Jung-Un period, attention is rising in North Korean society in relation to patents, trademarks and design, which come under the purview of intellectual property. 

It has been reported that last year, Kim Jung-un emphasised the importance of acquiring international trademarks and international standards and urged [Korean companies to do so].

Last December the Rodong Sinmun carried a large number of reports on intellectual property rights.  

It was pointed out that developing a well equipped system for the protection of intellectual ownership is an essential requirement for constructing an economically powerful nation. The construction of a [facilitative] economic and legal environment was also emphasised.
