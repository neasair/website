      <description>Is Taiwan Really Buying the ‘Wrong’ Weapons? The Diplomat March 31, 2020
https://thediplomat.com/2020/03/is-taiwan-really-buying-the-wrong-weapons/
Few were surprised when Taiwan’s presidential election resulted in the return of the America-friendly Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Tsai Ing-wen this January. As expected, Tsai’s tough stand on the issue of Taiwanese sovereignty was a winner, with the Hong Kong extradition protests serving as a timely warning of the dangers of the “one country two systems” model Beijing wants to impose on Taiwan.</description>

Kim Hwang-rok, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency
In mid February, while North Korea was still beset with the ‘triple hardships’ of international sanctions, the Corona virus and natural disasters, its Foreign Ministry announced that its ambassador to China, Ji Jae-ryong (74), would be replaced by Lee Yong-nam (61).</description>

      <description>Taiwan’s cabinet reshuffle a response to China’s ‘unrestricted warfare’ The Strategist 12 Mar 2021
https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/taiwans-cabinet-reshuffle-a-response-to-chinas-unrestricted-warfare/
Last month, Taiwan’s government announced several personnel changes in leadership positions in its defence and security team, including the key posts of defence minister and National Security Bureau director.
While at least one of these changes had been months in the making, the fact that several occurred concurrently, and were announced just after the Chinese New Year break, has prompted conjecture that certain recent developments have prompted a shift in the island’s strategic thinking&amp;hellip;</description>

A New Milestone On October 27 1979, the day after Park Chung-hee was killed, it was declared that the entire nation with the exception of Jeju island would be under a state of emergency. On that same day the Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah became the acting president. High ranking military officials held a meeting over October 29 and 30 and agreed to abolish the Yushin reforms, and on November 10 Acting President Choi, in compliance with the Yushin constitution, was elected to be the new President.</description>

Joe Biden should follow the course set by Donald Trump; there should be no U-turn based on naive hopes that goodwill can temper President Xi Jinping’s growing and increasingly impatient desire to pressure Taiwan into capitulation&amp;hellip;</description>

The annual Yushan Forum was inaugurated in 2017, yet has quickly come to assume the mantle of one of Taiwan’s leading non-governmental platforms for international dialogue. Its 2020 incarnation was no different, and featured keynote speeches from influential political figures including President Tsai Ing-Wen, Australia’s former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and Sweden’s former Prime Minister Carl Bildt.</description>

The Overall Defence Concept (OCD), which was first outlined in 2017 by Taiwan’s revered former Chief of General Staff, Admiral Lee Hsi-ming, represented a paradigmatic shift in Taiwan’s approach to its defence. Many foreign analysts felt it marked a watershed moment in which the island’s leaders had finally cast aside national pride, and embraced an approach to Taiwan’s defence that belatedly acknowledged what they had been saying for years – that the balance of power across the Taiwan Strait had well and truly shifted in China’s favour&amp;hellip;</description>

https://taiwaninsight.org/2020/01/22/the-2020-taiwan-presidential-election-south-korean-media-coverage-wrap-up/
Taiwan’s presidential elections often attract extensive media coverage in South Korea. On account of the growing volume of economic and people-to-people interaction between Taiwan and South Korea, as well as marked historical, demographic and cultural proximities between these two former Japanese colonies, many of the reports and analyses on Taiwan’s elections emanating from South Korea’s media are insightful, well informed, and arguably more multifarious in content than is the case in Western media sources.</description>

The 2019 Yushan Forum, hosted by the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation, lived up to its hype as a major forum on Asian trade and regional integration. In a major coup, this year’s programme succeeded in attracting a number of prominent speakers, including Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, who delivered the event’s opening address, her Vice President Chen Chien-jen, India’s former foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon, and Sandra Oudkirk, the U.</description>

近年來中朝關係屢經波折，尤其自二零一六年起，波動更為顯著。朝鮮自二零一六年初期進行數次核武和導彈試驗觸怒了北京， 導致中國罕見地支持聯合國對朝鮮實施制裁，使兩國關係陷入了新低谷。不過，從二零一八年三月起，一系列「習金會」以隆重的 規格召開，帶動中國大幅度增加了與朝鮮政府各階層的合作計劃和對朝經濟支援。此發展與許多分析家所提出的中朝「唇齒相依」 的特殊關係已不存在之說略顯不符。為什麼會這樣？&amp;hellip;</description>

America’s Department of Defence announced on Monday that it had approved the sale of military equipment worth approximately 2.2 billion American dollars to Taiwan. The deal includes 108 M1a2T Abraham tanks and 250 FIM-92 Stinger Man-Portable Air Defence Systems. Many American media reports pointed out that the sale occurred in the backdrop of the ongoing trade war between America and China.</description>

The last few years have witnessed dramatic oscillations in the tenor and substance of the Sino-North Korean relationship. As is well known, the relationship suffered a deep dive in 2017 through to mid-2018 on the back of a number of North Korean missile and nuclear weapons tests — provocations that prompted China to publicly rebuke Pyongyang and even support sanctions against the hermit state.</description>

Debate is continuing in China about an article published over a week ago titled Don&amp;rsquo;t let Li Ka-shing run. Produced by the Outlook Think Tank, a subsidiary of the state mouthpiece Xinhua, the article was seen to reflect official angst at Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s formerly favoured &amp;lsquo;superman&amp;rsquo; entrepreneur and Asia&amp;rsquo;s richest man.
Its main criticism was directed at Li&amp;rsquo;s decision to sell-off prime Chinese assets when anxieties about the economy are growing.</description>
