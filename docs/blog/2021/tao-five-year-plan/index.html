<p>By Shi Longhong, Liu Huan, Chen Shu</p>
<p>In a regular press conference held on March 17, the Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian 
explained the parts of China’s 14th Five Year that relate to cross strait relations, saying that she 
hoped Taiwanese compatriots would understand all facets of the ambitious blueprint for the future 
development of the nation’s infrastructure that were set out in the summary. She also said that the 
plan contains substantial room for development, and if Taiwanese can grasp the opportunity and take 
advantage of it, they themselves can achieve greater development, and together with their mainland 
brethren help create a bright future for the great rejuvination of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Zhu Fenglian pointed out that the 14th Five Year Plan outline clearly specifies the promotion of the 
objective/task of advancing the peaceful development of cross strait relations and the unification of 
the motherland as a key part of the new journey towards the full faceted construction of a modernised 
socialist nation, and this reflects the [high] strategic value work on Taiwan has in relation to making 
progress towards rejuvinating the nation&hellip;</p>
<p>Zhu said that China continues to persist with a people-centred approach to development, is guided by 
an intention to improve the welfare of compatriots across both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and will 
continue to perfect institutional arrangements and policy measures aimed at safeguarding the wellbeing 
of Taiwanese compatriots, treat Taiwanese and Taiwanese companies the same as those from the mainland, 
and further the development of cross strait integration. China will proactively drive efforts to raise 
the quality and increase the efficacy of cross strait interactions in each domain, bring together 
compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan strait so that they can pass on and promote China’s splendid 
traditional culture together , strengthen ethnic identity through interaction and cooperation, and 
facilitate a meeting of minds.</p>
<p>Zhu stated that China holds firm to the one China principle and the “92 Consensus,” and is resolute 
in its determination to oppose and curb any form of “Taiwan independence” separatist activities. We 
are willing to create plenty of leeway for peaceful reunification, but we definitely will not grant 
any leeway to any type of ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities.</p>
<p>In response to a question in relation to the main driving force behind Taiwan’s economic growth, Zhu 
pointed out that the volume of trade across the strait in 2020 was US$260.81 billion, out of which 
US$200.66 billion was Taiwanese exports to mainland China. According to calculations from the Taiwan 
side, exports to mainland China and Hong Kong make up 43.9% of Taiwan’s total export volume. Taiwan’s 
economic development is tied in with mainland China. Mainland China has secured its footing in a new 
stage of development, is implementing new development concepts, building new development patterns, and 
is pushing high quality development - all of which is bringing great opportunities for Taiwan’s economic 
development, and is very favourable to our Taiwanese compatriots. We hope that compatriots across the 
Taiwan strait strengthen economic cooperation in order that Taiwan’s economy can have brighter prospects, 
and our Taiwanese compatriots can derive greater benefits&hellip;</p>
<p>[On the matter of Taiwanese students enrolling to study in Chinese tertiary institutions], Zhu said that 
in recent years mainland China’s universities and colleges have been accelerating the push for first 
rate universities and the construction of first rate departments, and quality provision in education is 
continuously improving. More and more Taiwanese students are seeing this and are choosing to go to 
mainland China to study on their own accord. Even though 2020 was impacted by the Covid 19 pandemic, the 
enthusiasm for registering for mainland Chinese university and college entry exams has not been dampened 
in the case of more than a few Taiwanese students. Currently the number of Taiwanese students studying 
in mainland Chinese universities and colleges is 12,000&hellip;</p>
<p>Zhu said that we sincerely welcome Taiwanese students to come to mainland China to study and develop, 
and advised prospective students to get information for registering for entrance exams from authoritative 
sources such as the official pages of schools, the Taiwan Straits Admissions Service Centre website and 
the Mainland Universities and Colleges Admissions Information Website for Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan 
[Prospective Students] (大陆高校面向港澳台地区招生信息网).</p>
