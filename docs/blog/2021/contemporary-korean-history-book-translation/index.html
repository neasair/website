<h2 id="a-new-milestone">A New Milestone</h2>
<p>On October 27 1979, the day after Park Chung-hee was killed, it was declared that the entire nation with
the exception of Jeju island would be under a state of emergency.  On that same day the Prime Minister
Choi Kyu-hah became the acting president. High ranking military officials held a meeting over October 29
and 30 and agreed to abolish the Yushin reforms, and on November 10 Acting President Choi, in compliance
with the Yushin constitution, was elected to be the new President. It was declared that the new president
would amend the constitution within the shortest timeframe possible. From this it is clear that the
Yushin was a Park Chung-hee one-man regime constructed to grant him eternal power.</p>
<p>The democratisation movement were not able to respond to the events of October 26 immediately. On November
22 students from Seoul University clamoured for the Yushin system to be completely abolished and staged
a protest which called for an early amendment to the constitution. On November 24 more than 400 democracy
figures congregated at the Seoul YMCA auditorium, and published a ‘people’s declaration’ calling to
prevent the election of the president by delegates from the National Council of Unification, and demanding
that the whole nation should have an impartial cabinet and an early general election. The YMCA rally was
also aimed at investigating who it was that actually held the reigns of power behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The response to the requests for democratisation were frosty, and Choi Kyu-hah was ‘elected’ as president
by the National Council for Unification and assumed office on December 21. Participants of the YMCA
meeting were helped in their efforts to recognise where the true power actually laid when they were
dragged to the Defense Security Command bureau set up by the new military, where they suffered unspeakable
indignities and torture (the so-called YMCA fake wedding ceremony incident).[Since political gatherings
were banned, the meeting was held under the pretense of being a wedding ceremony.]</p>
<p>While the later stages of the Park Chung Hee regime saw two forces emerging in the military, the battle
for hegemony between them began as soon as the 10.26 incident occurred. Jeong Seung-hwa etc of the upper
echelons thought that the Yushin system was only suited for Park Chung Hee and wanted to change it. Chun
Doo-hwan and co of the cadres centred around the secret, private Hanahoe (‘Group of one’) group inside
the military, planned to retain the framework of the Yushin system. A coup d’etat by a group centred
around the members of the Hanahui, which Park Chung Hee cultivated, occurred on December 12. On December
12, in his capacity as the security commander, the head of the Martial Law Command’s Joint Investigation
Headquarter’s Major General Chun Doo-hwan, together with Roh Tae-woo, instigated a coup d’etat and
arrested the army’s Chief of Staff and Martial Law Commander General Jeong Seung-hwa without the President’s
sanction. It was a mutiny. America secretly showed it favoured the 12.12 coup d’etat over the forces
suppressing the coup d’etat.</p>
<p>The New Military of Chun Doo-hwan and co, who gained control of the military through the 12.12 coup d’etat,
remained behind the scenes of power for a considerable period of time. It appeared that the government
was responding to the ‘Seoul Spring’ call for the reinstatement of the 687 figures including [former
President] Yun Posun and [South Korea’s later President] Kim Dae-jung. However, Chun Doo-hwan becoming
the director of the KCIA in April 1980 was a bad omen.</p>
<p>The new military was waiting for an opportunity. Just like the case of the 1961 coup d’etat, where the
conspiring forces intended to stage a coup d’etat right on the one year anniversary of the April 19 movement
when it was expected that protests would intensify, the new military found a similar opportunity.</p>
<p>The ‘Seoul Spring’ was unstable. Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung were unable to show a united front.
Students were focused on their priority of strengthening the capacity of the weak student movement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on April 21, the Sabuk Coal Mine Labor Struggle broke out. The miners, who were very dissatisfied
with the executives of the yellow union (i.e., company dominated union) at the Sabuk Coal Mine, started a
demonstration before clashing with police. On the 22nd the wives of the protesting miners joined them,
and on the 23rd the number of protestors grew to more than 3000. The Sabuk situation, throughout which
the precinct police station was occupied, and during which, for a while, governmental entities such as
the Sabuk station and rail lines were taken over and virtually paralysed, showed what frightening things
could happen when authorities tried to ruthlessly suppress a labor dispute.</p>
<p>On April 24, 361 professors from 14 universities based in Seoul published a manifesto on the situation on
campuses which called for the democratisation of universities. This was the largest scale demonstration
by a group of university professors since 25 April 1960&hellip;</p>
