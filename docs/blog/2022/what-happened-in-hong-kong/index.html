        <p>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S NOTE:<br>
This is an excerpt from my draft translation of &ldquo;What happened in Hong Kong?&rdquo; (2021) - a widely shared, free<br>
Chinese language ebook that was compiled by a group of anonymous authors affiliated with Hong Kong&rsquo;s pro-democracy<br>
movement. The book discusses the history of the 2019 Anti-extradition Movement, including its causes, constitution, key<br>
events/milestones, and legacy. While it presents an informed and well structured account of this important part of<br>
Hong Kong&rsquo;s modern history, its enormous value lies in its authors&rsquo; ability to draw from the experiences, insights<br>
and perspectives of the movement&rsquo;s &ldquo;insiders.&rdquo; As such, it contains details that could only be known by those<br>
intimate with the movement, and it presents a narrative that differs markedly from that constructed by<br>
China/Hong Kong&rsquo;s state media, as well as the &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; accounts of journalists and scholars. In order to<br>
produce a complete English translation of this work, I am currently running a crowd-funding campaign on Pozible.<br>
The finished product will be free for distribution.</p>
<p>Since this was originally written as a non academic book, this translation aims to balance the two objectives of<br>
remaining faithful to the original, and being readible to non-Chinese readers who are completely unfamiliar with<br>
Hong Kong&rsquo;s history, society and culture. As my translation is in the draft phase, I welcome<br>
comments/suggestions from readers.</p>
<p>NOTE: For legal reasons, I have added the word &lsquo;alleged&rsquo; in incidences where allegations of misconduct/criminal<br>
offences have not been upheld in a court of law.</p>

<p><em>(Draft)</em></p>
<h2 id="preface-what-happened-in-hong-kong">Preface: What Happened in Hong Kong?</h2>
<p>Over the last couple of years many people have been asking “What happened in Hong Kong?”<br>
The millions that took to its streets in protest might each have their own answers.</p>
<p>The Anti-extradition Movement first broke out in 2019. Fake news about the movement has been<br>
peddled by Hong Kong and Chinese state media sources and has become widespread. A<br>
large amout of records were also compiled by non-state sources including the movement’s<br>
participants, as well as journalists and scholars. However, as the movement underwent drastic<br>
changes, the challenges of seeing through the filtered narratives of the state media machine, and<br>
sifting through the enormous volume of information, made it hard to understand how the<br>
movement had evolved. We imagine that many must be wondering: was the movement devised by<br>
just a handful of radicals? Why did protesters continue to take to the streets after the extradition bill<br>
was withdrawn? Why did the movement last for such a long time? How did this leader-less<br>
movement organise itself? Was it fighting for Hong Kong’s independence from China? Did the<br>
movement continue into 2020? What impact did the National Security Law have on the movement?</p>
<p>We began planning this book in spring 2020 to promote honest reflection and debate on these very<br>
questions. Our aim was to discuss the movement’s historical context, and track the evolution of the<br>
movement from when it was first triggered by the extradition bill in 2019 up until the spring of 2021.<br>
The book reviews the movement’s historical context, structure and development systematically. Due to its<br>
limited size, it doesn’t cover every detail. However, for those interested in knowing more, it provides<br>
footnotes with references to media reports and interviews, QR codes which link to videos, and, at the<br>
end of each chapter, a list of further readings.</p>
<p>This book contains seven chapters:<br>
<strong>1. Historical context – the background to the Antiextradition Movement</strong>;<br>
<strong>2. The Anti-extradition Movement</strong>;<br>
<strong>3. How did the movement organise iteslf without leaders?</strong>;<br>
<strong>4. Street protests</strong>;<br>
<strong>5. Logistics and support networks</strong>;<br>
<strong>6. Other forms of resistance</strong>;<br>
<strong>7. The post-National Security Law period</strong>.</p>
<p>1,<br>
The 2019 protest movement had its roots in 30 years of Hong Kong democracy movements.<br>
At the same time, it abandoned the modus oprandi of those earlier movements. The <strong>Historical context</strong><br>
chapter provides a three part historical outline of Hong Kong’s political environment<br>
at the eve of the anti-extradition movement, and discusses the key factors that shaped this<br>
environment. The first part provides a macro-perspective of the social contradictions resulting<br>
from <strong>The political legacy of colonial rule</strong>. Part two reflects on Beijing’s thoughts on<br>
governing Hong Kong, changes in the territory’s political economy, and the evolution of Hong<br>
Kongers’ identity in the post-handover period. The final section looks into the political<br>
ideologies of Hong Kong social movements, and shifts in relation to their repertoires of<br>
contention.</p>
<p>2,<br>
While the trigger for the anti-extradition movement was the amended extradition bill, the<br>
objectives of the movement quickly branched out into broader opposition to the government<br>
and the police, as well as demands for more wholesale societal change. Chapter 2, titled<br>
<strong>The Anti-extradition Movement</strong>, starts by looking at the amended bill that triggered the<br>
movement, and delves into the movement’s developments between February 2019 (when the<br>
Po Leung Kok charity group proposed the bill) and 30 June 2020 (when the National Security<br>
Bill was gazetted). To make it easier for readers to understand this process, we divided it into<br>
three stages, pointed out key events, and discussed shifts in the movement’s aims and tactics.<br>
At the end of the chapter we answer often-raised questions such as what was the movement’s<br>
public mandate, whether or not it was a Hong Kong independence movement, and what the<br>
term <em>laam caau</em> means.</p>
<p>3,<br>
Chapter 3, titled <strong>How did the movement organise itself without leaders</strong>, is divided into<br>
two sections. It looks into how demonstrators got together, mobilised themselves, and<br>
participated in such large numbers despite being leaderless. The first section looks at<br>
principles of action which were widely agreed upon by the movement’s participants such as<br>
“Don’t cause division, don’t cut fellow protestors off, don’t be a snitch” 不分化、不割蓆、<br>
不篤灰, and “no distinction between peaceful and pugnacious protesters” 和勇不分. Part<br>
two introduces the New media platforms that were used to help participants communicate<br>
and coordinate with each other. It looks into the roles these platforms played in the<br>
movement, the clampdowns they were subjected to, and their limitations.</p>
<p>4,<br>
In the last half of 2019 the streets became the locus of direct resistance. It also became the site<br>
where demonstrators gained shared experiences and connected with the broader movement.<br>
The first part of <strong>Street protests</strong> looks into the Hong Kong police force’s violent crackdowns,<br>
alleged use of torture and sexual violence, indiscriminate mass arrests, as well as acts of<br>
extrajudicial violence perpetrated by government supporters. The second part discusses the<br>
different forms of street protests and their tactics, including large scale peaceful demonstrations,<br>
clashes, blocking roads and shutting down the city, <em>si liu</em> (extrajudicial forms of retaliatory<br>
punishment), <em>zong sau</em> (‘renovationg’ = damaging property), and flash mob demonstrations. Large<br>
scale demonstrations kept the vitality of the movement in the public eye, drove more people to<br>
join in, and helped open up other ‘fronts’ for heaping pressure on the administration.</p>
<p>5,<br>
During the wave of protests a large number of the movement’s participants set up<br>
<strong>logistics and support networks</strong> to meet the needs of demonstrators, and to keep protests going in<br>
the face of government crackdowns and surveillance. Logistics and support networks looks at<br>
the formation and operation of the networks behind <strong>The publicity team</strong>, <strong>Instant messaging</strong>,<br>
<strong>Logistics networks</strong>, <strong>Medical aid and emotional support</strong>, and <strong>Support networks for protesters who were arrested</strong>.<br>
These compact and resilient social networks became a vital node for connecting participants and helping<br>
them sustain their connections. They also helped the movement take root in people’s lives and in<br>
local communities.</p>
<p>6,<br>
Towards the end of 2019 crackdowns made street protests hard to sustain. The slack was taken<br>
up by support networks, unions, the international and legislative fronts, and the yellow<br>
economic circle. <strong>Other forms of resistance</strong> looks at the evolving roles of unions, the District<br>
Council, and the yellow economic circle, as well as their practices, impacts and limitations. In<br>
the beginning of 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic hit Hong Kong, and as this became a new political focal<br>
point, networks formed during the movement mobilised to became agents for society to ‘fight the<br>
pandemic ourselves.’</p>
<p>7,<br>
On 30 June 2020 the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed the Hong Kong National<br>
Security Law. The next day the Hong Kong government announced the law’s implementation. The National<br>
Security Law was more than just a piece of legislation – its ideological tenets and approach to governance<br>
marked a new era. <strong>The Post-National Security Law period</strong> provides a summary discussion on the political<br>
implications of the legislation. Delving into ideology, mass prosecutions, the legislative front, and<br>
civil society networks, it addresses how the government combined this legislation with pre-existing legal<br>
and political tools to crack down on and control civil societies.</p>
<p>When this book was about to be published over 10,000 people had already been arrested and were<br>
facing unfair trails and lengthy sentences. From the beginning of 2020 it seemed that the tear gas<br>
had cleared and the disturbing images of the prior year had faded. However, after the<br>
implementation of the National Security Law, authoritarian state control, and a massive societal<br>
transformation, rapidly unfolded. The front line of resistance shifted from the streets to every facet<br>
of Hong Konger’s lives. History was quietly being rewritten, and the traces of the movement were<br>
being erased, drowned out by the state media machine’s own version of the ‘truth’ of what occurred<br>
in 2019. Yet in spite of this, the people did not forget what really happened. In that year, tens of<br>
thousands of Hong Kongers were no longer content to be quiet and docile. They jumped into action<br>
to resist the authorities’ march towards oppression, and showed them that “the new normal is the<br>
problem.” After 2019 the people of Hong Kong no longer pretended that life could go on as before.<br>
We are in a dark moment of time, but this is also the very moment to come together and forge our<br>
future.</p>
<p>This book was written for those who resisted the legislation that were imprisoned, that had marched<br>
on the streets, and that had taken up the struggle and never gave up hope. It is also written for those<br>
who want to understand the protest movement. Unfortunately, what we have compiled does not<br>
cover the movement in its entirety, and merely provides snippets for readers who want to know<br>
more about Hong Kong. We hope it helps us breach the walls that divide us, opens up dialogue, and<br>
serves as a starting point for forging new connections and continuing the fight.</p>

<em>Image source - Studio Incendo</em></p>
<p>Street protests were the first front line of the anti-extradition movement. In the second half of 2019, they were<br>
the core ‘incidents’(1) via which tens of thousands of people stood up to the government. Through these protests,<br>
the movement&rsquo;s participants came together and learned to cooperate, developed support networks, shared common experiences,<br>
and forged bonds and a sense of unity. Yet the costs born by protesters who took to the streets were grave. Thousands<br>
suffered damage to their health or lost their freedoms or even their lives. Nonetheless, large scale protests showed the<br>
public the movement’s vitality, and by so doing, drew in more people, and opened up other fronts for piling pressure on<br>
the government. When taking to the streets became more difficult in 2020, those other fronts - logistics and support<br>
networks, support for those arrested, the union front, the international front and the legislative front – took up the slack.</p>
<p>During the Anti-extradition Movement the government&rsquo;s official narrative was that the protesters were riotous thugs that<br>
were destroying Hong Kong. They didn&rsquo;t mention that the administration and the police had devoted enormous resources to<br>
violently crack down on protesters. Part I of this chapter outlines the administration’s violent crackdowns, their alleged<br>
use of torture, sexual violence, mass arrests, and their complicity in extrajudicial violence. Part II introduces the<br>
street tactics and types of demonstrations that formed against the backdrop of these crackdowns, including large scale<br>
peaceful protests, clashes, attempts to block roads and shut down the city, extrajudicial forms of retaliatory punishment<br>
(私了 <em>si liu</em>: lit. - settling affairs privately), destruction of property (裝修 <em>zong sau</em>: lit.,‘refurbishment’), and<br>
flash mob demonstrations.</p>
<p>1, TRANSLATOR’S NOTE: The use of word “incident” is symbolic  - the word used in the Chinese book is 事件 (<em>shijian</em> in Mandarin,<br>
<em>si gin</em> in Cantonese), which is the same word mainland Chinese (and some other) sources use to refer to the Tiananmen massacre<br>
(in China it is called the ‘May 4 Tiananmen incident’ 四五天安门事件).</p>

<h2 id="41-the-governments-violent-crackdown">4.1 The Government’s Violent Crackdown</h2>
<p>During the anti-extradition protests government propoganda justified the authorities&rsquo; violent crackdowns on demonstrators<br>
by accusing the latter of being riotous thugs. The government and the police devoted enormous resources to applying force<br>
against demonstrators and prosecuting them in order to deter people from protesting. Police used lethal force to crack down<br>
on demonstrators, sent letters  of objection to clamp down on the people’s freedom to assemble and protest, and arrested<br>
and prosecuted a large number of protesters. At the same time, the police and the Department of Justice sat by and did<br>
nothing as supporters of the government assaulted  protesters. They even shielded the perpetrators, or let them off lightly.<br>
However, not only did the authorities’ violence fail to  quell disorder, but it also had the opposite effect - it damaged<br>
the legitimacy of the government and the police, and prompted  demonstrators to adopt more radical measures.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="411-the-use-of-force-torture-and-sexual-violence">4.1.1 The Use of Force, Torture and Sexual Violence</h2>
<p>During the Umbrella Movement Hong Kong police fired 87 tear gas canisters. By contrast, during the Anti-extradition Movement<br>
police fired 15,732 gas canisters, 9,991 rubber bullets, 1,996 bean bag rounds, 1,830 sponge grenades, and 19 live rounds.<br>
Excluding the use of water cannons, vehicles and sound bombs, this made for a combined total of nearly 30,000 rounds.</p>
<p>In reality, even faced with protesters using the ‘highest levels of force’ (i.e., throwing miscellaneous objects, bricks, and<br>
bottles containing lit flammable materials), fully armoured police did not face serious threats to their safety. Yet police used<br>
a large volume of potentially lethal sponge grenades, rubber bullets and bean bag rounds against protesters, causing<br>
permanent injuries. Some ambulance crews and reporters suffered permanent loss of vision, and many protesters who were arrested<br>
were allegedly beaten after they were subdued. More than 100 of those charged were unable to attend their first hearings due<br>
to injuries. Those injuries included brain injuries, swelling, bruising, temporary loss of hearing or vision, broken bones<br>
and shattered bones.(1) According to public hospital records, over the duration of the movement in 2019, at least 2,633 people<br>
who participated in mass events sought treatment for injuries at emergency wards (since police often arrested injured protesters<br>
when they were in hospital, many sought treatment through non-official medical networks - as such, the official figure is the<br>
tip of the iceberg).</p>
<p>Aside from the sites of protests, many cases of protesters being subjected to torture and sexual violence allegedly took place<br>
in the dark corners of police stations’ holding cells, and when suspects were subjected to body searches. A report compiled by<br>
Amnesty International collected witness statements from arrested persons, lawyers and medical personnel. These exposed alleged<br>
acts of retaliatory violence including brutal beatings, abuse, and shining pen lasers into arrested persons’ eyes. Over the<br>
duration of the movement there were many allegations of demonstrators being asked to submit to strip searches,(2) being slapped<br>
on their breasts and private parts, being sexually assaulted, or being subjected to sexual violence.(3) By mid 2020, the<br>
Hong Kong Police Brutality Database 香港警察濫權實錄資料庫, which was built by grassroots activists, collected and categorised<br>
about 1,700 alleged cases of police misconduct.</p>

<p>During the anti-extradition protests, the vast majority of those who were victims of police brutality were unable to pursue<br>
justice. Not only did the complaints system have structural deficiencies, but protesters felt pressured to refrain from speaking<br>
up, and citizens feared that pursuing cases of police brutality could lead to them being arrested. Under the current system,<br>
citizens can only submit complaints through the Complaints Against Police Office unit (CAPO), whose reports are examined by<br>
the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC). Since CAPO is attached to the police force, and since the IPCC has no power<br>
to investigate and punish offenders, it is questionable whether lodging a complaint is worth the effort.(1) Over the last 10<br>
years only 10% of complaints have been substantiated, and these have typically resulted in little more than reprimands or<br>
warnings, with only one resulting in a criminal prosecution. When citizens made civil claims or applied for a judicial review,<br>
not only were they required to spend an enormous amount of time and money, but since police officers had not worn their<br>
identification numbers and had covered their faces to obscure their identity, collecting pertinent evidence and determining<br>
liability was extremely difficult. Over the duration of the Anti-extradition Movement, not a single police officer was<br>
subjected to criminal proceedings for acts of violence perpetrated during the protests.(2)</p>

<h2 id="412-mass-arrests-and-prosecutions">4.1.2 Mass Arrests and Prosecutions</h2>
<p>The Public Order Ordinance (POO), a bad law left over from the colonial era, places significant limits on the freedom to assemble<br>
and protest. Under this law, protests featuring more than a certain number of people must have their time and route submitted<br>
in advance, and can only proceed after a letter of ‘no objection’ has been issued by the Commissioner of Police. If protests go<br>
ahead without this letter, participating parties can be imprisoned for up to 5 years for the crime of “taking part in an<br>
unlawful assembly.” In addition to this, the legal definition of the crime of ‘rioting’ is extremely vague, and carries a<br>
hefty penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment. According to POO section 19, a ‘riot’ is when a gathering constitutes an<br>
“unlawful assembly” and its participants “breach the peace.” Put another way, if a demonstrator participating in an<br>
‘unlawfully assembly’ “breaches the peace,” the judge could charge anyone present for ‘rioting’ based on his or her consideration<br>
of the level of collective violence, as opposed to only considering the violence perpetrated by the individual being charged.</p>
<p>During the anti-extradition protests, police often sent out letters of objection to demonstrators, and kettled (i.e., encircled<br>
and arrested) large crowds. From June 2019 to November 2019, the number of monthly arrests shot up from 73 to 2,899 people. Prior<br>
to this, the post-colonial period’s Special Administration Region’s government was less strict in its application of this colonial<br>
era law, and few were convicted. In 5,529 public gatherings between 2003 and 2014, only 16 protesters were prosecuted. But in<br>
the anti-extradition protests up until 30 June 2020, police arrested 9,216 people, of which 1,972 were prosecuted. Those<br>
arrested faced tortuously long judicial proceedings, curfews and potential sentences, all of which deterred demonstrators<br>
from continuing to participate in the movement.</p>
<p>Overall, charges against anti-extradition protesters were far more severe than those leveled against participants of the<br>
Umbrella Movement. The longest sentence metered out during the umbrella movement was that of the so-called ‘three occupiers<br>
of Central’ (中環三子 - Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and Chiu Yiu-ming), who were imprisoned for 16 months. During the<br>
anti-extradition protests, 653 people faced up to 10 years in jail for ‘rioting,’ which was the most common charge. One person<br>
who participated in the June 12 protest, Sin Ka-ho, was the first person to be sentenced for ‘rioting’ after he received 6<br>
years (reduced to 4 years due to a guilty plea) for throwing a helmet, traffic cone and umbrellas at the police line.(1)</p>

that was subjected to adjudication in 2020 resulted in harsher sentences.(2)</p>

<h2 id="413-extrajudicial-violence">4.1.3. Extrajudicial Violence</h2>
<p>Not only did the administration directly crack down on the anti-extradition protests - there were also many instances<br>
in which supporters of the administration attacked demonstrators, those joining Lennon Walls, volunteers manning stands,<br>
those applying for demonstration permits, and District Council candidates. On July 21, people dressed in white shirts attacked<br>
both demonstrators and other citizens indiscriminately in Yuen Long, a town located in the New Territories. Groups<br>
of pro-establishment loyalists who were Triad members also brandished weapons in shows of force on several occassions at<br>
Hong Kong Island’s North Point, and at the New Territories’ Chuen Wan district. On August 7, knife wielding men wearing blue<br>
shirts attacked demonstrators. And in Tseung Kwan O on August 20, a volunteer for the Lennon Wall suffered a puncture wound<br>
from a knife attack and was rushed to hospital.^1^ On October 19, a young person handing out fliers at a Lennon Wall event<br>
was seriously injured after he suffered a knife wound to his abdomen.(2)</p>
<p>In several assaults targeting demonstrators, the police, judges and the Department of Justice shielded the alleged perpetrators<br>
(i.e., the Department of Justice intervened to have charges against a driver who hit a demonstrator in Sham Shui Po withdrawn,<br>
and a judge praised the person who attacked people participating in the Lennon Wall as someone of “exemplary character”^3^). Lam<br>
Cheuk Ting, who made a report to the police after he was attacked by men in white shirts during the “July 21” 2019 Yuen Long<br>
attack, was arrested a year later for participating in a riot. Cases where pro-establishment loyalists who allegedly attacked<br>
people were not punished, and those who were allegedly attacked by them fell victim to political oppression, were key factors<br>
that inspired protesters to meter out retaliatory punishment (<em>si liu</em>).</p>

<h2 id="42-street-protests">4.2 Street Protests</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the anti-extradition movement, peaceful demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of the Extradition Law<br>
Amendment Bill featured up to 1 or 2 million participants. Nonetheless, the government refused to make concessions and clamped<br>
down on the protests. On 1 July 2019, protesters stormed the Legislative Council building and occupied the central<br>
legislative chamber. This was a prologue of more radical forms of resistance. Between July and November, the police and<br>
government’s crackdowns on the demonstrations not only failed to subdue them, but also served to radicalise them. Large<br>
scale demonstrations subsequently came to be complemented by, and alternate with, more radical protest actions. Protesters<br>
continued to stage large scale peaceful demonstrations, while some used guerrilla tactics to block roads, engage in clashes,<br>
damage property, and meter out retaliatory punishments - all of which were responses to the authorities’ violent crackdowns,<br>
and put pressure back on the authorities by increasing the government’s costs and causing economic damage. Since<br>
anti-extradition protesters generally supported more radical measures, peaceful demonstrators known as <em>woleifei</em><br>
(和理非 = “peaceful, rational and non-violent” protestors), and more pugnacious protesters, called <em>jungmou</em><br>
(勇武 = the ‘valiant’), each did things their own way, but still had each other’s backs.</p>
<p>The anti-extradition protests were marked by tactics known as “blooming everywhere” (<em>pindei hoifaa</em> 遍地開花) and<br>
“be water.”(1) “Blooming everywhere” meant decentralising protest actions. In July 2019, protests fanned out from the<br>
political and economic centre of Hong Kong island to Kowloon and the New Territories, and into local communities. “Be water”<br>
meant not sticking to set patterns, remaining flexible, adapting to changes, and constantly shifting. When the police objected<br>
to a protest application, or temporarily shut down public transport services, citizens used the web to organise<br>
‘guerrilla’ demonstrations without prior notice and without following a set route. When major roads were blocked and<br>
transportation was paralysed, they organised flash demonstrations. Towards the end of 2019, following harsh crackdowns on protests<br>
in universities, it became difficult to hold large scale demonstrations and street clashes. Flash demonstrations in the<br>
suburbs subsequently became the most prominent form of political protest in the public domain. Up until mid 2020,<br>
public demonstrations declined due to the substantial reduction in the number of attendees, which occurred against the backdrop<br>
of the COVID-19 pandemic and government crackdowns.</p>
<p>1, This comes from Bruce Lee’s famous line: “Empty your mind, be formless,  shapeless, like water. Put water into a cup.<br>
Becomes the cup. Put water into a teapot. Becomes the teapot. Water can flow or creep or drip or crash. Be water my friend.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Taking to the streets was not only a form of public demonstration. It was also a key training ground for the masses to learn<br>
to engage in resistance. When police brutality followed “blooming everywhere” protests into the suburbs, malls and near<br>
peoples’ homes, more and more citizens witnessed police engaging in unwarrented violence and arbitrary arrest (for example,<br>
a teargas canister hit a local resident when police were attempting to disperse a crowd,^1^ and a local resident having a<br>
stroll was charged by riot police for participating in an unlawful assembly2). The movement also reached more people and spawned<br>
new networks. Demonstrators in different districts subsequently formed their own groups (for instance, local Lennon Walls,<br>
street-side booths, information channels for people scouting protest sites). As the people involved had met each other, the<br>
networks, resources and experiences they accumulated helped the movement grow roots in the local community. We will now look<br>
at some of the different types of protest actions that were to take place on the streets.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="421-large-scale-peaceful-protests">4.2.1 Large Scale Peaceful Protests</h2>
<p>While the Anti Extradition Movement contained ‘radicalised’ elements, large scale peaceful demonstrations still played a key<br>
role. Radical actions were dangerous and fast paced, so their bar for participation was relatively high. Large scale<br>
peaceful protests, on the other hand, gave a larger number of citizens the opportunity to express their views.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the movement, organisations such as the Civil Movement Rights Front conducted large scale protests<br>
after applying for them in advance and receiving letters of no objection. This created a safe platform for the city’s residents<br>
to have their voices heard. If the scale of a protest is to be seen as a guage of public sentiment, then the enormous turnout<br>
could be seen to reflect the substantial scale of public support for the movement. In the last half of 2019, several<br>
demonstrations featured over one million participants.^1^ This figure was also surpassed in the 1 January 2020 demonstration,<br>
which was titled “Don’t forget your promise, stand with us” (<em>moumong singnok, binggin tonghaang</em> 毋忘承諾，並肩同行).</p>
<p>During these protests the throng of people overwhelmed ferries and subway stations, and this forced those assembled at Victoria<br>
Park to wait several hours before setting off. Since the demonstrations had been granted letters of no objection,<br>
demonstrators waited at the park for quite a while. They brought along self-made banners, leaflets and supplies, and - when<br>
not shouting out slogans - chatted with fellow participants. From August 2019, large scale protests featuring tens of thousands<br>
of participants were being convened across many districts.</p>
<p>After this, police began to regularly ‘object’ to protest proposals. This resulted in organisers having no other choice but<br>
to cancel demonstrations. However, since the movement was without core leaders, and since even the demonstrations that were<br>
allowed resulted in police clampdowns and mass arrests, many residents gradually gave up being constrained to seeking ‘letters<br>
of no objection,’ and took to the streets in ad-hoc ‘unlawful protests.’ For example, on 27 July, tens of thousands of<br>
residents occupied the streets and demonstrated in Yuen Long on the pretexts of ‘outings,’ and participating in a ‘memorial<br>
service’ for Li Peng (i.e., the CCP official that sent armed forces to suppress the Tiananmen protests of 1989). On August 18,<br>
1.7 million residents also took to the streets on Hong Kong island. Due to the police clampdown, there was a reduction in the<br>
number of large scale peaceful protests that had been applied for in advance, and an increase in ‘guerrilla-type’ protests<br>
in different suburbs whose attendance numbers are difficult to assess.</p>
<p>1, This is based on the movement’s own attendance estimates. Police estimates were considerable lower - however,<br>
the credibility of the latter has been widely questioned.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="422-clashes">4.2.2 Clashes</h2>
<p>Police use of force during the anti-extradition movement, which involved the heavy use of gas canisters and<br>
potentially lethal ordinance, was far greater than it was during the Umbrella Movement. Yet some of the protesters felt that<br>
the only way to carry the movement forward was to use more &lsquo;radical&rsquo; forms of resistance - otherwise, it was feared, the<br>
movement might end up tapering off and fail like the umbrella movement. One result of this is that protesters often used the<br>
guerrilla tactic of blocking off roads after protests. Donning crude forms of protective equipment, protesters faced off against<br>
police after erecting defensive perimeters. They extinguished tear gas canisters to prolong their actions in the area, and at<br>
times threw miscellaneous objects, fragments of bricks taken from the sidewalk, and petrol bombs. They only withdrew, or moved<br>
to another location, when police moved in to arrest them.</p>
<p>Even though these protesters were more willing to strike first than was the case in earlier protests, asymmetries<br>
between protesters and police in terms of the level of force at their disposal remained extremely large. Police wore<br>
flame resistant uniforms, impenetrable body armour, and carried a large volume of deadly weapons. Attacks from protesters<br>
(throwing bricks, miscellaneous objects and bottles containing flammable materials over a long distance) were incapable of harming<br>
the police, and would merely serve to delay police offensives. In reality, up against well equipped police and the<br>
prosecutorial powers of the judiciary, these more radical protesters were subjected to draconian crackdowns, and were unable to<br>
sway the administration. Despite this, the resolve they showed had a rallying effect and spurred on more people to join the movement.</p>
<p>These more radical measures were supported by demonstrators. The <em>woleifei</em> protesters protected the rear of the front line<br>
until all of the protesters left together. When traffic controls and body searches became common, the woleifei distributed<br>
and carried sensitive items to the protest site, and formed human chains to deliver things to the front line. When the<br>
<em>jungmou</em> made ‘renovations,’ the <em>woleifei</em> often raised rows of umbrellas to block the view of CCTV cameras so that the former<br>
could avoid being identified. This came to be called “raising your umbrella in the rain.” The thinking behind this was as<br>
follows: the <em>woleifei</em>, whose role involved few risks, helped reapportion the risks by supporting the <em>jungmou</em>, and did so in the<br>
hope that all participants would be able to leave safely.</p>

<h2 id="423-guerrilla-tactics-blocking-roads-and-shutting-down-the-city">4.2.3 ‘Guerrilla’ Tactics: Blocking Roads and Shutting Down the City</h2>
<p>In August 2019 police escalated their clampdown by issuing a series of ‘letters of objection’ and shutting down<br>
transport services prior to scheduled protests. This prompted demonstrators to begin developing more flexible ‘guerrilla’<br>
tactics such as having no set route, and making impromptu relocations and retreats. Realising that the pressure public<br>
demonstrations were bringing to bear on the government was limited, protesters often blocked roads after demonstrations. They<br>
also explored ways to hit the economy and have an impact on public order through instigating a ‘non-cooperation movement.’</p>
<p>On August 5 Hong Kong netizens launched the August 5 General Strike and Simultaneous Demonstrations across Seven<br>
Districts(1) 八五全港大三罷、遍地開花七區集會.(2) For the first time, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators assembled in<br>
different districts simultaneously, surrounded police stations with flash mobs, and blocked major arterials, which paralysed<br>
transport across some parts of the city. After this, responses to pertinent political developments tended to involve general<br>
strikes, and, wherever protesters assembled, large scale occupations of roads, the erection of roadblocks, and standoffs with<br>
police – all of which blocked citizens from going to work and stopped businesses from opening. For example, 11 August<br>
saw guerrilla-style protests erupt across several districts. On October 4, protests and roadblocks also popped up<br>
across several districts in response to the government announcing the implementation of the Prohibition on Face Covering<br>
Regulation. During the police siege at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in November, a series of demonstrations and road blocks<br>
popped up across a number of districts over several days. Demonstrators on multiple occasions also called upon the public to<br>
storm the airport. This resulted in several flights being canceled, and caused substantial economic losses.</p>
<p>These guerrilla-style attempts to block roads and halt transport had a big impact on Hong Kong citizens’ daily lives. In<br>
the past, public opinion was often against these sorts of actions. However, since many of those that took part in<br>
the anti-extradition protest paid a heavy price as a result of crackdowns, even more demonstrators were willing to<br>
accept inconveniences and losses so that the fight could continue. Among those who supported the movement, only 15%<br>
disapproved of demonstrators paralysing the airport, and only 9% disapproved of them blocking the MTR (i.e., the subway system).</p>

Bottom-left panel: “Unjustifiable prosecutions”) (TRANSLATORS NOTE: &lsquo;Griffin&rsquo; is a hononym for <em>si liu</em>)</p>
<p>After August 2019, two radical measures, <em>si liu</em> (retaliatory punishment, lit., “private settling of affairs”) and <em>zungsao</em>  (damaging<br>
property, lit., “renovating”), became common. <em>Si liu</em> referred to demonstrators using force against attackers. In the beginning of July,<br>
a volunteer participating in a Lennon Wall was praised after being punched 13 times and not fighting back. However, after several protesters<br>
were assaulted and seriously injured, and police connived in the attacks and even arrested the victims, demonstrators stopped appealing to<br>
the authorities to intervene, and fought back in self defence - even attacking perpetrators in groups.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Zong sao</em> or ‘renovating’ was a term used by demonstrators which means “damaging public infrastructure or pro-establishment shops.” The<br>
movement’s first <em>zong sao</em> was the late August Tsuen Wan Mahjong Parlor Incident. Subsequent to this, moderate and large sized groups of<br>
demonstrators damaged the shop fronts of stores that supported the police or were associated with pro-establishment attackers, as well as<br>
mainland Chinese banks and bookstores. For example, during the peak of the protest movement in October and November, 72 stores belonging to<br>
the retailer Bestmart 360, which has been accused of being associated with the ‘Fujian gang,’^1^ suffered varying degrees of damage. ATM’s<br>
belonging to mainland Chinese banks were vandalised, and at one time one tenth of the city’s 3,000 ATM’s were not operational. In addition,<br>
since the MTR cooperated with the police, cancelled services to help suppress the protests, and also helped the authorities dispatch police<br>
resources and arrest demonstrators, protesters damaged subway station infrastructure by smashing ticket vending machines, graffitiing, and<br>
setting things on fire.^2^ More than 90% of subway stations were damaged, and the cost of repairs reached hundreds of millions of Hong Kong<br>
dollars. Other than serving as a form of extrajudicial punishment for those who were not sanctioned by the authorities, ‘refurbishments’<br>
reflected the logic of <em>laam caau</em> (i.e., ‘mutual destruction,’ or actions that show a willingness to harm oneself in order to harm others)<br>
– protesters destroyed infrastructure to paralyse businesses, and the city more generally, to increase the costs to the government, and the<br>
scale of economic damage.</p>
<p><em>Si liu</em> and <em>zong sau</em> were very controversial since they involved the use of force, and interrupted people’s lives. However, on the back<br>
of many months of rising discontent against the government and anger at police misconduct, demonstrators and citizens felt, to a relatively<br>
large degree, that these measures were understandable. Less than half of Hong Kong’s citizens disagreed with the use of <em>si liu</em> and <em>zong sau</em>,<br>
and among supporters of the movement this number dropped to less than 30%. Nonetheless, there were numerous incidents where acts of <em>si liu</em> and<br>
<em>zong sau</em> were disproportionate (i.e., a person who hurled abuse at protesters was doused with flammable liquids and set on fire,^3^ which some<br>
demonstrators felt was taking things too far). Such incidents were the cause of substantial controversy in the movement, and prompted demonstrators<br>
to come up with a set of guidelines so that everyone would be on the same page. An example was: “‘refurbish’ the ‘black’ (i.e., anti-demonstration<br>
businesses associated with the Triads – Triads = ‘black societies’), ‘decorate’ the ‘red’ (paint or stick posters/slogans on mainland Chinese<br>
owned or Chinese government owned businesses), help out the ‘yellow’ (support businesses that support the protest movement), boycott the ‘blue’<br>
(i.e., pro-establishment stores/business).” Another set of guidelines were outlined in a post titled “Compromise between the <em>jungmou</em> and<br>
<em>woleifei</em>: the rules of engagement are online.”</p>

<h2 id="425-flash-mob-demonstrations">4.2.5 Flash Mob Demonstrations</h2>
<p>From September 2019 protesters often staged ‘human chains/holding your hand,’ ‘sing with you’ and ‘lunch with you’ demonstrations in several districts’<br>
mall atriums, housing complexes, schools, and near factories and large buildings. These demonstrations were relatively small in scale, peaceful, and<br>
inclusive in the sense that they set a low bar for participation. After protesters in one district demonstrated by singing or lunching together in<br>
malls, those in other districts copied them, resulting in demonstrations spawning across several districts. Since those participating in these<br>
demonstrations were often locals, they could quickly form flash mobs wearing whatever they left home in. As such, these protesters blended together with<br>
other citizens and local residents, making it more difficult for police to suppress the protests and arrest people.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4251-human-chains">4.2.5.1 Human Chains</h2>
<p>Inspired by the Baltic Way,^1^ in August 2019 anti-extradition protesters formed a human chain that connected three rail lines and spanned 44 kilometres.<br>
The aim was to stage a peaceful demonstration which would attract global attention. After this, ‘human chain’ demonstrations frequently occurred in work<br>
places, schools, and at local protests, become more geographically scattered, and morphed into something akin to a daily routine. In September medical staff<br>
formed a human chain in a hospital to denounce the excessive use of force by police, which had impeded paramedics from treating injuries. Several middle<br>
schools were the sites of human chains and school strikes^2^ that protested police brutality and reiterated the Anti-extradition Movement’s Five Demands.<br>
Their turnouts, which included students and alumni, were substantial. On December 31 demonstrators in Tsim Sha Tsui formed a ‘New Year’s Way,’ repeating the<br>
movement’s demands, and commemorating the 831 Prince Edward MTR station incident.</p>
<p>1, TRANSLATORS NOTE: Also known as the Chain of Freedom. This refers to the 1989 human chain that stretched across three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and<br>
Lithuania), and that was intended to draw attention to Baltic campaigns for independence from the Soviet Union.<br>

<h2 id="4252-sing-with-you">4.2.5.2 Sing with You</h2>
<p>In early September 2019 a group of people sang a song composed by a protester titled ‘Wishing Hong Kong a return to its former glory’<br>
(<em>yuen wing gwong gwai Heung gong</em> 願榮光歸香港) at the atrium of a mall in Sha Tin district, New Territories. After this, protesters sang in chorus,<br>
yelled out slogans, and held up banners in major malls across different districts, and ‘sing with you’ demonstrations became widespread and frequent.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="4253-lunch-with-you">4.2.5.3 Lunch with You</h1>
<p>Beginning early October 2019, over 1000 demonstrators participated in a series of lunchtime flash mob demonstrations in Central to protest the fatal shooting of<br>
a protester by police, and the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation. During October, workers participated in flash mob demonstrations in the business districts<br>
of Kwai Fong, Lai Chi Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwun Tong. ‘Lunch with you’ demonstrations occurred in several districts during a general strike and non-cooperation<br>
movement conducted from 11-15 November.</p>

<p><img src="https://neasair.org/img/whihk/chapter_5_head.jpg" alt="Support-and-logistics" title="Support and logistics"></p>

<hr>
<p><em>During the Anti-extradition Movement, behind-the-scenes logistics networks supported actions on the streets. Due to a smear campaign,</em><br>
<em>logistics work and economic and material support were often seen as evidence that the movement was doing the bidding of a hidden paymaster.</em><br>
<em>In reality, while demonstrators were supported by many benefactors and volunteers, they were not part of organisations funded by so-called</em><br>
<em>‘foreign powers’ – they were backed by ordinary citizens who contributed their own time and money to the cause, and who did so on their own initiative.</em></p>
<p><em>These support and logistics networks kept abreast of changes in the political climate and the evolving needs of protesters. They kept</em><br>
<em>demonstrations going in the face of harsh government crackdowns. We will introduce five types of support networks: <strong>publications</strong>,</em><br>
<em><strong>instant messaging platforms, logistics support, medical aid and emotional support, and assistance for arrested persons.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The publications team ‘decentralised’ the dissemination of information and mobilised the people. Since the Anti-extradition Movement was</em><br>
<em>without media spokespersons or leaders, demonstrators developed their own publications networks to distribute information, send out details</em><br>
<em>about protest routes, and mobilise demonstrators.</em></p>
<p><em>Instant messaging platforms helped people share up-to-the-minute information about volatile and shifting protest sites. In the last half of 2019,</em><br>
<em>demonstrators conducted several hundred protests of various kinds, and this required protesters to frequently exchange and coordinate large volumes</em><br>
<em>of information in order to keep assemblies away from police deployments, and to plan escape routes.</em></p>
<p><em>Logistics support refers to key backers of actions on the streets. As crackdowns harshened, protesters needed more logistics support, including</em><br>
<em>the provision of protective equipment and other material resources, economic support, safe havens, access to transport for leaving protest sites,</em><br>
<em>etc. To respond to the ever changing needs of demonstrators, protesters developed ‘large scale open source platforms’ and smaller ‘parental networks’</em><br>
<em>which collected and distributed resources and coordinated services. These networks meant that demonstrators facing crackdowns were not stranded and</em><br>
<em>without help.</em></p>
<p><em>During the movement a large number of demonstrators suffered injuries, emotional problems, and even arrest and prosecution. As a result,</em><br>
<em>those fighting the extradition bill organised medical aid and emotional support networks, as well as networks for assisting protesters</em><br>
<em>who were arrested. Over ten thousand protesters were arrested, and their needs changed as they went through the stages of being taken into custody,</em><br>
<em>attending court hearings and trials, serving sentences, and readjusting to life after they were released from prison. To address these needs,</em><br>
<em>a large number of people who opposed the extradition bill helped provide legal support, supported defendants in court as auditors, assisted those</em><br>
<em>in prison, and helped those released back into society find jobs. While by 2020 the streets became more quiet, dozens of protesters faced trials</em><br>
<em>and sentencings every day, and finding ways to support them became one of the major priorities of the movement.</em></p>
<p><em>During the Anti-extradition Movement, the time spent in actions on the streets was quite short. Amidst the surging and subsiding tides of large</em><br>
<em>scale protests, self-formed support organisations served as fixed nodes that allowed those that wanted to join in and play their part build</em><br>
<em>connections and establish networks. The presence of companions also encouraged those that discovered their ‘place’ in the movement</em><br>
<em>to keep up their participation. The trust and connections cultivated in these &lsquo;blooming everywhere&rsquo; networks made them the sites of new fronts</em><br>
<em>as actions on the streets became unsustainable.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="51-publicity-team-informing-and-mobilising-the-masses">5.1. Publicity team: Informing and mobilising the masses</h2>
<p>During the Anti-extradition Movement the government frequently held press conferences to hog the limelight in the mainstream media.<br>
They also devoted a lot of resources to smearing demonstrators. Hong Kong’s mainstream media’s coverage of the protests was<br>
lopsided. To push back against the views presented on television stations and print media, demonstrators countered government press<br>
conferences with dozens of ‘people’s press conferences.’ Students and online media volunteers also conducted live interviews, and<br>
reports at the scenes of protests which captured images of alleged instances of serious police misconduct. In addition to this, a<br>
large number of those fighting the extradition bill joined in the production and dissemination of publicity materials, creating a<br>
large, decentralised publicity network. In an ever-changing movement, these networks built consensus among opponents of the bill and<br>
won over support from the community.</p>
<p>When protests first broke out, participants designed leaflets and manned street stands to spread the word on the pernicious<br>
ramifications of the extradition bill, and mobilise large scale demonstrations. Beginning June 2019, protesters set up a Telegram<br>
channel, and printed materials which were either posted on mosaic Lennon Walls, or distributed via street stands. Over the year-long duration<br>
of the movement, participants gradually integrated and coordinated their efforts, and worked out ways to make the dissemination of<br>
their messages more extensive and up-to-the-minute.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, while publicity networks didn’t all operate in the same way, they all featured two core parts – production and<br>
dissemination. Production included checking information and designing texts and images. Dissemination included online dissemination,<br>
printing, distributing, or posting on Lennon Walls. A Telegram (social networking platform) channel, where information was brought<br>
together and organised, facilitated the sharing of resources, and was a platform that allowed production and distribution to operate<br>
side by side. Anyone could submit content, and anyone could download and post content on Lennon Walls or distribute them from street<br>
stands. This chapter looks at the behind-the-scenes work that went into the production and dissemination of information, as well as<br>
the development and evolution of these publicity networks.</p>

<h2 id="511-production">5.1.1. Production</h2>
<p>The ‘production’ of publicity materials marked the first step in the publicity chain. During the anti-extradition protests, new<br>
media platforms accumulated vast volumes of accurate and up to date materials. These were compiled by a large number of anonymous<br>
demonstrators who shared them with the public without claiming copyright. From June 2019, the Anti-extradition Promo Channel, on the<br>
Telegraph social networking platform, uploaded more than 38,000 pictures and videos. While this channel’s administrator was both a<br>
producer and publisher of content, almost 70% of its content was provided by other demonstrators. Many other publicity channels and<br>
anonymously composed materials emerged over the course of the movement, and this kept individual channels and authors from<br>
monopolising the movement’s voice.</p>
<p>Since there were so many content contributors, the style and themes of the movement’s publicity materials were extremely diverse.<br>
They included striking drawings, posters pairing pictures with text, comics, illustrated news and commentaries. Since they were about<br>
‘publicity’ there was little room for two-way conversations, and the materials used emotion, information and insight to quickly<br>
mobilise people. Commonly seen themes were integrating information, mobilising the movement and building consensus. We will now<br>
illustrate these with examples.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5111-integrating-information-what-happened-how-should-we-read-information">5.1.1.1 Integrating information: What happened? How should we read information?</h2>
<p>In the last half of 2019, protests, arrests and crackdowns occurred on an almost daily basis. At the same time, the government<br>
frequently called press conferences to hog the limelight on mainstream media platforms and smear the demonstrations. As a result,<br>
protesters struggled to keep track of all the pertinent news and information, and sift through it effectively in order to understand the<br>
broader dynamics at play. Against the backdrop of this, ‘publicity networks’ continued to summarise milestones within the movement,<br>
fact-check information and rebut the government’s claims, and work through vast swaths of information and produce more digestible<br>
news wrap-ups. The themes they covered were diverse, including aggregating incidences of police misconduct, analying the electoral<br>
system, and even providing briefings on the pandemic and anti-epidemic measures.</p>
<p>In reality, the publicity networks provided more than just information. They also reflected the interpretations, concerns and<br>
perspectives of the protesters. The networks used ‘hyped up’ images and news that would resonate with people, and interpreted<br>
information in a way that reflected a particular standpoint, hoping to subtly inject a critical stance on the government into the<br>
public discourse.</p>

<h2 id="5112-mobilising-people-into-action-what-can-we-do-how-do-we-do-it">5.1.1.2 Mobilising people into action: What can we do? How do we do it?</h2>
<p>Demonstrators know that “having a lot of people” is the key to energising a movement. Because of this, they always promote their<br>
cause in order to mobilise people into action, and emphasise that each person’s participation can effect change. In the early<br>
stages of the Anti-extradition Movement, people were primarily inspired by the frequent protests themselves. But aside from taking<br>
to the streets, demonstrators sought to participate in other ways. Some distributed leaflets, served as scouts, drove ‘parent cars’<br>
(i.e., cars which picked up protesters), patronised the yellow economic circle, or joined unions. Publicity teams broke down<br>
complicated tasks into basic steps and showed people how to do them, which lowered the bar for participation, and allowed people<br>
without any experience to master tasks quickly. For example, publicity teams would put together a collection of QR codes for each new<br>
union to make it easier for demonstrators to find out about, and join, the specific union that represented their vocation.</p>

<h2 id="5113-build-consensus--synchronise-protesters-demands-gain-community-support">5.1.1.3 Build Consensus:  Synchronise Protesters’ Demands, Gain Community Support</h2>
<p>During the Anti-extradition Movement demonstrators didn’t have the time or space to discuss matters face to face. Because of this,<br>
the movement’s publicity infrastructure became a key platform for managing disputes and building consensus. When the actions of more<br>
radical demonstrators created controversy, they used this infrastructure to explain what motivated their actions and seek out<br>
others’ understanding. As the movement evolved, protesters’ compiled publicity materials with updated demands and slogans, and<br>
sychronised them with the movement’s direction.</p>
<p>Publicity work relied heavily on people taking the initiative to create and distribute materials. As such, slogans that were<br>
disseminated on a large scale were those which expressed demands that met other demonstrators&rsquo; approval. For example, after the storming<br>
of the legislature on July 1, slogans centred around the phrase “Five demands, not one less” were widely shared. As the protests continued<br>
to heat up, the slogans in publicity materials changed from those encouraging Hong Kongers to “try their best,” to urging “resistance” and<br>
“avengance.” The intended audience of publicity materials wasn’t only supporters of the movement – as the publicity content creator Small Potato<br>
(熱血小薯) stated: “We want to break out of our bubble and rope in more support from members of the middle class who are moderate<br>
pro-protesters, neutrals, and moderate anti-protesters.”</p>

<h2 id="512-dissemination">5.1.2 Dissemination</h2>
<p>No matter how good the content, publicity materials can’t have an impact unless they reach people. The deployment of various<br>
‘media platforms’ during the Anti-extradition Movement made it a lot easier to distribute them. Not only were publicity materials<br>
sent out through forums on the LIHKG website, several Telegram channels and - as was popular in the Umbrella Movement – dedicated<br>
Facebook pages, but a lot of demonstrators also forwarded materials using Telegram groups and their personal social media accounts.<br>
They even won over the internet by engaging with netizens from other countries.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some Hong Kongers found it hard to accept information that can only be found on social media. Moreover, these platforms’<br>
algorithms tended to keep this information confined to users of the same political persuasion. Because of this, real (non-virtual)<br>
public spaces were the main battleground for disseminating publicity materials. &lsquo;Blooming everywhere&rsquo; Lennon Walls and street stands<br>
became the last leg of the publicity chain, and were used to spread information to different districts promptly and with versatility.</p>
<p><strong>It is worth noting that the Lennon Walls and street stand networks that popped up to hand out publicity materials became,</strong><br>
<strong>surprisingly, key sites for connecting supporters of the movement. The volunteers in these networks were mainly people that</strong><br>
<strong>lived nearby. When they prepared walls and stalls they would get together and chat, play table tennis, celebrate festivals,</strong><br>
<strong>and set up bazaars. Locals who became well acquainted and gained each other’s trust through these activities were able to</strong><br>
<strong>look after and help each other when trouble broke out in their district.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5121-lennon-walls">5.1.2.1 Lennon Walls</h2>
<p>The original Lennon Wall was a wall at the Velkopřevorské náměstí in Prague, former Czechoslovakia (Czechia), and was a place where residents used<br>
graffiti to express their dissatisfaction at their government.(1) During the Umbrella Movement of 2014, protesters stuck a banner on<br>
a concrete wall at the ‘Occupy Admiralty’ site which said “Why are we taking a stand?”, and many residents responded by posting<br>
sticky notes which expressed their views. This came to be known in Hong Kong as the ‘Original Lennon Wall,’ and the phenomena<br>
subsequently spread to different ‘occupy’ sites.</p>
<p>In the Anti-extradition Movement, Lennon Walls “bloomed everywhere” alongside demonstrations. Protesters would record their anger<br>
at the government, as well as the movement’s demands, on sticky notes, and place them on public spaces such as footbridges,<br>
housing estates, public transport, and along arterial roads. As publicity material production matured, protesters found that Lennon Walls<br>
were not only a place to bring together the voice of the streets – they could also be used as a bulletin board for assembling and<br>
distributing up-to-the-minute information, a site for communicating protesters’ views to the public, and a tool for publicising<br>
protest schedules. Within several months, protesters across many districts adapted Lennon Walls to the disparate geographies and<br>
social characteristics of each locale. Some were massive, visually striking mural-style ‘Lennon underpasses.’ There were<br>
also large, meticulously designed bulletin boards featuring thematic portrayals of current events, information divided into<br>
categories, and appeals to action.</p>

<p>Map showing the location of Anti-extradition Movement Lennon Walls across Hong Kong (Source: Hong Kong Lennon Wall Map).</p>
<p>1, Czechs began scrawling graffiti and writing the lyrics of songs composed by John Lennon on this wall in 1980. The wall<br>
subsequently became a place for expressing dissatisfaction towards the government.</p>
<hr>
<p>When Lennon Walls became prevalent across Hong Kong, networks for repairing and updating them gradually formed in many districts, and<br>
demonstrators started to use them to disseminate up-to-the-minute information. During the early phase of the movement, the risks<br>
associated with working on Lennon Walls were fairly low, and demonstrators across many districts would organise Lennon Wall teams into shifts<br>
to prepare the wall and promptly repair damaged publicity materials. However, when these volunteers suffered frequent attacks at the hands of<br>
pro-establishment supporters, and some residents who posted materials were arrested on charges of criminal damage, instances of<br>
protesters creating Lennon Walls in such an impromptu manner decreased.</p>
<p>As the risks of maintaining Lennon Walls increased, protesters formed small, fixed teams of volunteers to ‘do walls’ in short, sharp<br>
bursts. The participants of these teams each played different roles, and due to the threat of attacks and arrest, work had to be completed<br>
within only 10 minutes. Some members selected publicity materials, produced glue and stuck things on the wall. Some arrived in<br>
advance to scan the terrain and spot surveillance cameras. Some acted as ‘bodyguards’ tasked with subduing attackers. What is interesting<br>
is that different Lennon Wall publicity teams in the same district formed loose mutual-assistance networks, and when large Lennon<br>
Walls were damaged, several groups would mobilise themselves and quickly repair them. Lennon Wall volunteers across different<br>
districts also communicated with each other and shared new techniques and insights.</p>

<p><strong>Independent Media Interview of a Yuen Long Lennon Wall Volunteer:</strong></p>
<p>“‘Loud Guy’ (the name of the Facebook page of a person known by the alternative pseudonym Hou Dee,(1) who followed the protest<br>
movement) recalled that the streets were pretty quiet at first. But when people saw the publicity groups persevering day and night,<br>
they eventually come forward and took a look at what they were posting. In the end he saw what TVB News wasn’t reporting:(2) blue silks(3)<br>
walking by, ripping up postings, and calling the volunteers ‘crazy.’ He [Loud Guy] tried to persuade people to<br>
stop and take a look, and sure enough, some people stopped by. Some people supported protests but criticised them for being quite<br>
violent. Twenty or thirty people would gather in a circle and discuss the methods used to fight [the extradition bill],<br>
and each would say their piece, which gave everyone food for thought. Some protesters felt dispirited and searched through the<br>
sticky notes for a source of comfort. He even saw an elder gentlemen stand there for ten whole minutes, carefully read the publicity<br>
materials, and jot down notes.”(4)</p>
<p>1, The Chinese name of the Facebook page is 大聲哥哥 – literally ‘loud older brother.’ Hou Dee’s name often appears as 豪Dee.<br>
2, TVB is short for Hong Kong’s Television Broadcasts Limited, which pro-democracy activists accuse of having a pro-establishment bias.<br>
3, 藍絲. This refers to pro-establishment people who oppose pro-democracy advocates. In 2014 those participating in ‘occupy’<br>
activities used yellow ribbons to identify their connection to the cause. Those opposing them wore blue ribbons – hence the name.<br>

<h2 id="5122-street-stands">5.1.2.2 Street Stands</h2>
<p>Street stands refers to temporary stalls set up in public spaces where people promote ideas by giving speeches and handing out fliers.<br>
They had been frequently used by local political organisations for many years. During the Anti-extradition Movement, street<br>
stands erected by ordinary members of the public “bloomed everywhere,” and were used by those fighting the legislation to get their<br>
views across, and encourage more people to join in the fight. In addition to hosting speeches, stalls featuring video projections<br>
were quite prevalent. To bring attention to the problem of police misconduct, some demonstrators made short clips featuring<br>
compilations of alleged instances of police misconduct, and erected “Police brutality screening stands” in several districts.<br>
Protesters also broadcast documentaries on the movement in many districts to catch the attention of locals.</p>
<p><img src="https://neasair.org/img/whihk/chapter_5_winter_on_fire_screening.jpg" alt="Winter-on-Fire-screening" title="Winter on Fire screening"></p>
<p><em>29 August 2019： Screening of Winter on Fire: Ukraine&rsquo;s Fight for Freedom under an overpass in Mei Foo.</em></p>
<p>The first wave of street stands emerged in May 2019. LIHKG users and middle school students used social media to form teams and set<br>
up stalls for mobilising people to participate in the 9 June demonstration. Within half a month the number of stalls exploded and the<br>
public’s interest in opposition to the extradition amendment rose dramatically.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Street Stand Volunteer:</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I set up a Hong Kong-wide Roving Street Stand to talk about opposing the extradition bill. After I announced the time I would be</em><br>
<em>setting up the street stand on Facebook, a few volunteers joined in. Many of those volunteers also brought a few volunteers with</em><br>
<em>them, and the group got bigger and bigger. After that, those that had worked a street stand before or who were a bit proactive</em><br>
<em>opened new street stands themselves… As we travelled around the street stand group grew exponentially.</em></p>
<p><em>Someone in the group only needs to start a street stand [and say] “I need fliers” and “Can anyone prepare supplies” and everyone in</em><br>
<em>the group would put up their hands. I had an experience of one street stand which was really over the top – everyone bought their own</em><br>
<em>flyers, so on the day we were giving out five or six different flyers. It felt like [the miracle of Christ giving everyone] five</em><br>
<em>loaves of bread and two fish. Different people had different ideas. Some brought LED writing boards, some brought sticky notes, some</em><br>
<em>promptly performed demon-exorcising rituals on the floor – the [street stands] were full of vitality.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>After this, large amounts of street stands would appear, and would appeal to residents to participate in demonstrations immediately<br>
prior to calls going out for rallies or strikes. However, when police continuously ‘objected’ to protests, the use of stands to<br>
mobilise people to participate in demonstrations reduced, and a growing number of street stands focused on district council<br>
elections, recruiting members for new unions, conveying concerns about the Hong Kong Health Code proposal, and other matters.<br>
Earlier, many residents had been able to organise screenings at street stands and interact with each other at them for long periods<br>
of time. However, after attacks on street stand volunteers increased, volunteers at street stands needed to rely more on guards and<br>
‘self defence teams’ to maintain their safety.</p>
<p>In the last half of 2020 police occassionally obstructed street stands on the grounds that they violated COVID prevention laws<br>
that prohibited group gatherings. District Council representatives and unions continued to set up stands despite the clampdown.<br>
But these stands were no longer ‘blooming everywhere’ to the same extent, while those supporting the government were extremely active.</p>

<h2 id="52-instant-messaging-sharing-information-about-activities">5.2 Instant Messaging: Sharing Information about Activities</h2>
<p>Instant messaging platforms were the site of one of the earliest spontaneously formed networks of the movement. During the Umbrella<br>
Movement, some people with experience in social movements collected first-hand information on the ‘occupation’ sites.<br>
After verifying and collating this information, they posted it on a dedicated Facebook page. In the Anti-extradition Movement, people<br>
rarely issued orders, demonstrations were spread across Hong Kong and kept shifting, and the situation on the<br>
ground was extremely dynamic. Demonstrators had an urgent need for accurate information so they could weigh up risks before going<br>
into action. The information on instant messaging platforms became a crucial source for helping demonstrators plan their<br>
movements. For example, protesters would learn about the transport situation from social media channels before choosing which<br>
means of transport and which route they will take. And during protests, they would use the channels to get information on<br>
clashes at the protest&rsquo;s perimeters and police deployments in the area to evaluate when they should leave and what route they should take.</p>
<p>In the Surround the Legislature 包圍立法會 protest in June 2019, information wasn’t circulating on site, which prompted demonstrators<br>
to set up an instant messaging platform in order to promptly collect, verify, sort through and then publish information.<br>
To collect information, they didn’t only rely on live media reports, but also drew upon a network of ‘scouts’(1) who reported back on<br>
unfolding events. Most messaging platforms had established networks of scouts in order to make sure information is accurate. However,<br>
as the scope of protests kept expanding, ordinary people become an important source, and through ‘outsourcing to the public’,<br>
demonstrators were able to obtain a broader range of up-to-the minute information on protest sites. Publicity materials on<br>
messaging platforms taught people a standardised format for reporting on the situation at protest sites. The platform’s on duty<br>
account administrator paid attention to media reports and breaking news from netizens and would do his/her best to collate, verify<br>
and publish information within a short timeframe.</p>
<p>1, “Scouts” originally referred to the ‘footsoldiers’ of the movement that were responsible for alerting others when police were<br>
about to charge. Later it was used to refer to messengers who relayed information about what they observed at protest sites.</p>

<hr>
<p>As demonstrations ‘bloomed everywhere,’ several protests were occuring in different places on the same day. The pan-Hong Kong<br>
messaging platforms were no longer able to handle the vast amounts of information they were recieving. As a result, localised<br>
messaging platforms started to appear. These made it easier for demonstrators to focus on what was happening in their district. As<br>
the speed of police advances increased, it was hard for demonstrators who weren’t familiar with an area’s geography and environment<br>
to write in a way that captured the overall situation on the ground within a short period of time. Some protesters set up the 103.hk<br>
Real Time Map (103.hk 實時地圖), which identified sites of police deployments and police use of force, and thus allowed protesters to<br>
plan escape routes after just a short glance. Since migrants, domestic workers and foreigners had difficulty accessing information,<br>
demonstrators also set up an English instant messaging platform.</p>
<p><strong>103.hk Real Time Map Founder Chi Yau:</strong></p>
<p>During the 12 June Hong Kong Protest, one of Chi Yau&rsquo;s students was in a group that was trapped between tear gas cannisters at<br>
Citic Tower. Having nowhere to go, the protesters panicked and rushed into the building’s two glass doors, and came close to<br>
crushing each other in a stampede. On July 14, Chi Yao, who was out of town at the time, saw a live broadcast which showed that<br>
his familiar Sha Tin had all of a sudden turned into a smoke covered war zone. He saw police kettling and arresting people in a mall,<br>
and witnessed demonstrators dashing about frantically and not knowing where to go. Seeing that noone was helping these people,<br>
Chi Yao decided to create a real time map to help participants in the movement feel less unsafe, and to give everyone access<br>
to information that can help them determine for themselves which route they should take.(1)</p>
