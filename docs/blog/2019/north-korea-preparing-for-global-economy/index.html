<p>Kim Jung-un, chairman of North Korea’s state affairs commission, has personally come out and tried to raise awareness about intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Kim Jung-bae reports:</p>
<p>North Korea’s trademarks are mainly written words and are monotonous.</p>
<p>Recently, the international trademarks that North Korea are applying for are upon the first glance alone different in their appearance.</p>
<p>This is the application for ‘Virgin Snow’ (Cheotnun) - the symbol of a burgeoning state-run trading company operating under the banner of state preservation [picture shown in article].</p>
<p>It can be seen that the snow crystal has been simplified and the colour and size of the words in the centre are different.</p>
<p>Pyongyang Trolley produces buses and other items. Its classy logo, which contains the symbol of a Chollima (a mythical winged horse), holds its own against those of prominent global car makers.</p>
<p>In the Kim Jung-Un period, attention is rising in North Korean society in relation to patents, trademarks and design, which come under the purview of intellectual property.</p>
<p>It has been reported that last year, Kim Jung-un emphasised the importance of acquiring international trademarks and international standards and urged [Korean companies to do so].</p>
<p>Last December the Rodong Sinmun carried a large number of reports on intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>It was pointed out that developing a well equipped system for the protection of intellectual ownership is an essential requirement for constructing an economically powerful nation. The construction of a [facilitative] economic and legal environment was also emphasised.</p>
