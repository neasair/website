</blockquote>
<p>In the Liberal Democratic Party’s (LDP) campaign promises during the upper house elections, diplomacy was thrust to the forefront.</p>
<p>When Shinzou Abe became Japan’s Prime Minister for the second time in 2012, he touted his ‘diplomacy that takes a panoramic perspective of the world map’, as well as plans to visit a total of 167 countries and regions. The elevation of Japan’s presence in the international community was an area where he could boast the merits of a long-ruling administration. However, negotiations for the return of the Northern Territories from Russia, which Prime Minister Abe called the ‘culmination of post-war diplomacy’, and the stalemate in resolving the issue of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea, are still continuing. It appears that voices are growing stronger for concrete achievements from the person who is in sight of becoming the nation&rsquo;s longest serving prime minister.</p>
