Taiwan’s presidential elections often attract extensive media coverage in South Korea. On account of the growing volume of economic and people-to-people interaction between Taiwan and South Korea, as well as marked historical, demographic and cultural proximities between these two former Japanese colonies, many of the reports and analyses on Taiwan’s elections emanating from South Korea’s media are insightful, well informed, and arguably more multifarious in content than is the case in Western media sources.">

reached a crescendo following the election of the independence leaning former president Chen Shui-bien
