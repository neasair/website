The Overall Defence Concept (OCD), which was first outlined in 2017 by Taiwan’s revered former Chief of General Staff, Admiral Lee Hsi-ming, represented a paradigmatic shift in Taiwan’s approach to its defence. Many foreign analysts felt it marked a watershed moment in which the island’s leaders had finally cast aside national pride, and embraced an approach to Taiwan’s defence that belatedly acknowledged what they had been saying for years – that the balance of power across the Taiwan Strait had well and truly shifted in China’s favour&hellip;">

<p>The Overall Defence Concept (OCD), which was first outlined in 2017 by Taiwan’s revered former Chief 
of General Staff, Admiral Lee Hsi-ming, represented a paradigmatic shift in Taiwan’s approach to its 
defence. Many foreign analysts felt it marked a watershed moment in which the island’s leaders had 
finally cast aside national pride, and embraced an approach to Taiwan’s defence that belatedly 
acknowledged what they had been saying for years – that the balance of power across the Taiwan Strait 
had well and truly shifted in China’s favour&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://taiwaninsight.org/2020/01/22/the-2020-taiwan-presidential-election-south-korean-media-coverage-wrap-up/">https://taiwaninsight.org/2020/01/22/the-2020-taiwan-presidential-election-south-korean-media-coverage-wrap-up/</a></p>
<p>Taiwan’s presidential elections often attract extensive media coverage in South Korea. On account of the
growing volume of economic and people-to-people interaction between Taiwan and South Korea, as well as
marked historical, demographic and cultural proximities between these two former Japanese colonies, many
of the reports and analyses on Taiwan’s elections emanating from South Korea’s media are insightful, well
informed, and arguably more multifarious in content than is the case in Western media sources. Yet like
the latter, election coverage in South Korea often reflect wider concerns that changes in Taiwan’s relationship
with China could have broader ramifications for security in the Northeast Asian region. While such concerns
reached a crescendo following the election of the independence leaning former president Chen Shui-bien
(2000 and 2004), unease has risen again in this election on account that Taiwan’s returning president,
the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen, bolstered her campaign by emphasising the danger
that an increasingly assertive China poses to Taiwan’s independence and democracy&hellip;</p>
