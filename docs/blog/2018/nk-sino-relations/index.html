The last few years have witnessed dramatic oscillations in the tenor and substance of the Sino-North Korean relationship. As is well known, the relationship suffered a deep dive in 2017 through to mid-2018 on the back of a number of North Korean missile and nuclear weapons tests — provocations that prompted China to publicly rebuke Pyongyang and even support sanctions against the hermit state.">

<p>The last few years have witnessed dramatic oscillations in the tenor and substance of the Sino-North Korean 
relationship. As is well known, the relationship suffered a deep dive in 2017 through to mid-2018 on the 
back of a number of North Korean missile and nuclear weapons tests — provocations that prompted China to 
publicly rebuke Pyongyang and even support sanctions against the hermit state. However, North Korean 
leader Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping have since met on three occasions, and these meetings 
have been followed by a series of lower level bilateral forums and increases in Chinese aid. The latter 
developments not only defied trends; they also surprised many well-credentialed analysts whom several 
month ago concluded that the special, so-called “blood alliance,” or “lips and teeth” relationship between 
these two neighbors, is no more. How or why did these experts get it wrong?&hellip;</p>
